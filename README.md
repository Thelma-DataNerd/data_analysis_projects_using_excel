## Overview
This repository contains projects where Microsoft Excel was used for data analysis, visualization, and insights generation. 
Each project leverages Excel's functionality, such as pivot tables, charts, and formulas, to explore various datasets and provide meaningful business or academic insights.

## Projects
1. Student Mental Health Analysis

   
## Student Mental Health Analysis
## Project Overview
This project explores the mental health conditions among university students, focusing on key factors such as based on factors like CGPA, gender, 
marital status, year of study, and course of study.
The goal is to identify trends and provide insights into the distribution of mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes relevant to students' mental health:
Timestamp: Date and time of data collection
Gender: Male or Female
Age: Age of the students
Course of Study: The academic field each student is enrolled in
Year of Study: From Year 1 to Year 4
CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average
Marital Status: Single or Married
Depression/Anxiety/Panic Attack: Whether the student experiences these conditions (Yes/No)
Specialist Treatment: Whether the student sought medical treatment (Yes/No)

## Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Using Microsoft Excel for filtering, sorting, and handling missing data.
Pivot Tables: To summarize data across different attributes.
Charts and Graphs: Visualizing patterns and trends through histograms, pie charts, and bar charts.
Correlation Analysis: Exploring the relationship between age and mental health conditions.

## Results
Some of the key insights from the analysis include:
- Students with higher CGPA (3.50 - 4.00) experienced more panic attacks, while students with CGPA between 3.00 - 3.49 faced more depression.
- Female students had significantly higher rates of mental health conditions compared to males.
- First-year students showed higher vulnerability to anxiety and depression, likely due to academic and social adjustments.
- Only 6% of students sought medical treatment, indicating a potential gap in mental health awareness or access to resources.
